  "description": "1. You are given a partially written LinkedList class.\n2. You are required to complete the body of displayReverse and displayReverseHelper functions. The function are expected to print in reverse the linked list without actually reversing it. \n3. Input and Output is managed for you. \n\nNote -> The online judge can't force you to write recursive function. But that is what the expectation is, the intention in to help you learn.\n\n### Input Format\n```\nInput is managed for you\n```\n\n### Output Format\n```\nOutput is managed for you\n```\n\n### Constraints\n```\n1. Time complexity -> O(n)\n2. Space complexity -> O(n)\n```\n\n### Sample Input\n```\n11\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\n100\n200\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n```\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \n11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 \n200 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 100\n```",
