  "description": "1. You are given a number n, representing the number of rows.\n2. You are given a number m, representing the number of columns.\n3. You are given n*m numbers, representing elements of 2d array a, which represents a maze.\n4. You are standing in top-left cell and are required to move to bottom-right cell.\n5. You are allowed to move 1 cell right (h move) or 1 cell down (v move) in 1 motion.\n6. Each cell has a value that will have to be paid to enter that cell (even for the top-left and bottom- \n     right cell).\n7. You are required to traverse through the matrix and print the cost of path which is least costly.\nInput Format\nA number n\nA number m\ne11\ne12..\ne21\ne22..\n.. n * m number of elements\nOutput Format\nThe cost of least costly path.\nQuestion Video\nCOMMENT\nConstraints\n1 <= n <= 10^2\n1 <= m <= 10^2\n0 <= e1, e2, .. n * m elements <= 1000\nSample Input\n6\n6\n0 1 4 2 8 2\n4 3 6 5 0 4\n1 2 4 1 4 6\n2 0 7 3 2 2\n3 1 5 9 2 4\n2 7 0 8 5 1\n\nSample Output\n23\n\n\n\nEditorial\nAsked in Companies\nRelated Topics\n\n\nDo you need more personalize experience while solving question along with doubt support.\n\nBUY NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
