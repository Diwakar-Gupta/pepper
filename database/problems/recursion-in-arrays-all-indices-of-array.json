You are required to find the all indices at which x occurs in array a.\n5. Return an array of appropriate size which contains all indices at which x occurs in array a.\n\nNote -> The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is. Write recursive and not iterative logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.\nInput Format\nA number n\nn1\nn2\n.. n number of elements\nA number x\nOutput Format\nReturn the array of indices from the allIndices function.
