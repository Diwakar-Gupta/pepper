Complete the body of print Increasing function to achieve it. Don't change the signature of the function.\n\nNote -> The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is. Write recursive and not iterative logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.\nInput Format\nA number n\nOutput Format\n1\n2\n3\n..\nn\nQuestion Video\nCOMMENT\nConstraints\n1 <= n <= 1000\nSample Input\n5\n\nSample Output\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\n\nAsked in Companies\nRelated Topics\n\n\nDo you need more personalize experience while solving question along with doubt support.\n\nBUY NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
