  "description": "1. You are given a number following certain constraints.\n2. The key constraint is if the number is 5 digits long, it'll contain all the digits from 1 to 5 without missing any and without repeating any. e.g. 23415 is a 5 digit long number containing all digits from 1 to 5 without missing and repeating any digit from 1 to 5.Take a look at few other valid numbers - 624135, 81456273 etc.Here are a few invalid numbers - 139, 7421357 etc.\n3. The inverse of a number is defined as the number created by interchanging the face value and index of digits of number.e.g. for 426135 (reading from right to left, 5 is in place 1, 3 is in place 2, 1 is in place 3, 6 is in place 4, 2 is in place 5 and 4 is in place 6), the inverse will be 416253 (reading from right to left, 3 is in place 1, 5 is in place 2,2 is in place 3, 6 is in place 4, 1 is in place 5 and 4 is in place 6) More examples - inverse of 2134 is 1243 and inverse of 24153 is 24153    \n4. Take as input number \"n\", assume that the number will follow constraints.\n5. Print it's inverse.\nInput Format\n\"n\" where n is any integer, following constraints defined above.\nOutput Format\n\"i\", the inverted number\nQuestion Video\nCOMMENT\nConstraints\n1 <= n < 10^8, and follwing other constraints defined above.\nSample Input\n28346751\n\nSample Output\n73425681\n\n\n\nEditorial\nAsked in Companies\nRelated Topics\n\n\nDo you need more personalize experience while solving question along with doubt support.\n\nBUY NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
