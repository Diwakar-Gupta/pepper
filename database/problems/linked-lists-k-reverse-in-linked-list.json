  "description": "1. You are given a partially written LinkedList class.\n2. You are required to complete the body of kReverse function. The function is expected to tweak the list such that all groups of k elements in the list get reversed and linked. If the last set has less than k elements, leave it as it is (don't reverse).\n3. Input and Output is managed for you.\n\n### Input Format\n```\nInput is managed for you\n```\n\n### Output Format\n```\nOutput is managed for you\n```\n\n### Constraints\n```\n1.
