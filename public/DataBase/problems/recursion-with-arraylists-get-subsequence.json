Complete the body of getSS function - without changing signature - to calculate all subsequences of str.\nUse sample input and output to take idea about subsequences.\n\nNote -> The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is.\nWrite recursive and not iterative logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.\nInput Format\nA string str\nOutput Format\nContents of the arraylist containing subsequences as shown in sample output\nQuestion Video\nCOMMENT\nConstraints\n0 <= str.length <= 20\nSample Input\nabc\n\nSample Output\n[, c, b, bc, a, ac, ab, abc]\n\n\n\nAsked in Companies\nRelated Topics\n\n\nDo you need more personalize experience while solving question along with doubt support.\n\nBUY NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
