  "description": "1. You are given a partially written GenericTree class.\n2. You are required to complete the body of IsSymmetric function. The function is expected to check if the tree is symmetric, if so return true otherwise return false. For knowing symmetricity think of face and hand. Face is symmetric while palm is not. Also, we are check only smmetricity of shape and not content. Check the question video for clarity.\n3. Input and Output is managed for you.\n\n### Input Format\n```\nInput is managed for you\n```\n\n### Output Format\n```\nOutput is managed for you\n```\n\n### Constraints\n```\nNone\n```\n\n### Sample Input\n```\n20\n10 20 50 -1 60 -1 -1 30 70 -1 80 -1 90 -1 -1 40 100 -1 110 -1 -1 -1\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n```\ntrue\n```",
