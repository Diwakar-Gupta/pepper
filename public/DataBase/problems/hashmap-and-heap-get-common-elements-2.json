  "description": "1. You are given a number n1, representing the size of array a1.\n2. You are given n1 numbers, representing elements of array a1.\n3. You are given a number n2, representing the size of array a2.\n4. You are given n2 numbers, representing elements of array a2.\n5. You are required to find the intersection of a1 and a2. To get an idea check the example below:\n \nif a1 -> 1 1 2 2 2 3 5\nand a2 -> 1 1 1 2 2 4 5\nintersection is -> 1 1 2 2 5\n\nNote -> Don't assume the arrays to be sorted. Check out the question video.\n\n### Input Format\n```\nA number n1\nn1 number of elements line separated\nA number n2\nn2 number of elements line separated\n```\n\n### Output Format\n```\nAll relevant elements of intersection in separate lines\nThe elements of intersection should be printed in order of their occurence in a2.\n```\n\n### Constraints\n```\n1 <= n1, n2 <= 100\n0 <= a1[i], a2[i] < 10\nTime complexity should be O(n)\n```\n\n### Sample Input\n```\n7\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n5\n7\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n4\n5\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n```\n1\n1\n2\n2\n5\n```",
