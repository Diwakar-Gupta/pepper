  "description": "1. You are given a partially written LinkedList class.\n2. You are required to complete the body of findIntersection function. The function is passed two linked lists which start separately but merge at a node and become common thereafter. The function is expected to find the point where two linked lists merge. You are not allowed to use arrays to solve the problem.\n3. Input and Output is managed for you.\n\n### Input Format\n```\nInput is managed for you\n```\n\n### Output Format\n```\nOutput is managed for you\n```\n\n### Constraints\n```\n1. Time complexity -> O(n)\n2. Space complexity -> constant\n```\n\n### Sample Input\n```\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n8\n11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88\n2\n3\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n```\n44\n```",
