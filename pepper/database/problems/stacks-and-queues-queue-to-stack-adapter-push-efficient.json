  "description": "1. You are required to complete the code of our QueueToStackAdapter class. \n2. As data members you've two queues available - mainQ and helperQ. mainQ is to contain data and helperQ is to assist in operations. (This is cryptic - take hint from video)\n3. Here is the list of functions that you are supposed to complete\n     3.1. push -> Should accept new data in LIFO manner.\n     3.2. pop -> Should remove and return data in LIFO manner. If not available, print \n      Stack underflow\" and return -1.\n     3.3. top -> Should return data in LIFO manner. If not available, print \"Stack \n     underflow\" and return -1.\n     3.4. size -> Should return the number of elements available in the stack.\n4. Input and Output is managed for you.\n\nNote -> push and size should work in constant time. pop and top should work in linear time.\nInput Format\nInput is managed for you\nOutput Format\nOutput is managed for you\nQuestion Video\nCOMMENT\nConstraints\nNote -> push and size should work in constant time. pop and top should work in linear time.\nSample Input\npush 10\npush 20\npush 5\npush 8\npush 2\npush 4\npush 11\ntop\nsize\npop\ntop\nsize\npop\ntop\nsize\npop\ntop\nsize\npop\ntop\nsize\npop\ntop\nsize\npop\ntop\nsize\npop\nquit\n\nSample Output\n11\n7\n11\n4\n6\n4\n2\n5\n2\n8\n4\n8\n5\n3\n5\n20\n2\n20\n10\n1\n10\n\n\n\nAsked in Companies\nRelated Topics\n\n\nDo you need more personalize experience while solving question along with doubt support.\n\nBUY NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
