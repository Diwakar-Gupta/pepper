  "description": "1. You are required to complete the code of our MinStack class. \n2. As data members you've one stack and a min element available in the class. (This is cryptic - take hint from video)\n3. Here is the list of functions that you are supposed to complete\n      3.1. push -> Should accept new data in LIFO manner.\n      3.2. pop -> Should remove and return data in LIFO manner. If not available, print \n       \"Stack underflow\" and return -1.\n      3.3. top -> Should return data in LIFO manner. If not available, print \"Stack \n      underflow\" and return -1.\n     3.4. size -> Should return the number of elements available in the stack.\n     3.5. min -> Should return the smallest element available in the stack. If not \n     available, print \"Stack underflow\" and return -1.\n4. Input and Output is managed for you.\n\nNote -> The judge maynot be able to check if all your functions are O(1) in time, but that is what the expectation is. Also, you can only use constant space.r\nInput Format\nInput is managed for you\nOutput Format\nOutput is managed for you\nQuestion Video\nCOMMENT\nConstraints\nNone\nSample Input\npush 10\npush 20\npush 5\npush 8\npush 2\npush 4\npush 11\ntop\nmin\npop\ntop\nmin\npop\ntop\nmin\npop\ntop\nmin\npop\ntop\nmin\npop\ntop\nmin\npop\ntop\nmin\npop\nquit\n\nSample Output\n11\n2\n11\n4\n2\n4\n2\n2\n2\n8\n5\n8\n5\n5\n5\n20\n10\n20\n10\n10\n10\n\n\n\nAsked in Companies\nRelated Topics\n\n\nDo you need more personalize experience while solving question along with doubt support.\n\nBUY NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
