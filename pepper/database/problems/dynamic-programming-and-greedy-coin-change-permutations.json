You are required to calculate and print the number of permutations of the n coins using which the \n     amount \"amt\" can be paid.\n\nNote1 -> You have an infinite supply of each coin denomination i.e. same coin denomination can be \n                  used for many installments in payment of \"amt\"\nNote2 -> You are required to find the count of permutations and not combinations i.e.\n                  2 + 2 + 3 = 7 and 2 + 3 + 2 = 7 and 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 are different permutations of same \n                  combination. You should treat them as 3 and not 1.\nInput Format\nA number n\nn1\nn2\n.. n number of elements\nA number amt\nOutput Format\nA number representing the count of combinations of coins which can be used to pay the amount \"amt\"\nQuestion Video\nCOMMENT\nConstraints\n1 <= n <= 20\n0 <= n1, n2, .. n elements <= 20\n0 <= amt <= 30\nSample Input\n4\n2\n3\n5\n6\n7\n\nSample Output\n5\n\n\n\nEditorial\nAsked in Companies\nRelated Topics\n\n\nDo you need more personalize experience while solving question along with doubt support.\n\nBUY NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
