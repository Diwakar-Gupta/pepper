The functions are expected to reverse the linked list by using recursion and changing the \"next\" data member of nodes.\n3. Input and Output is managed for you. \n\nNote -> The online judge can't force you to write recursive function, nor can it check if you changed the \"next\" data member or not. But that is what the expectation is, the intention in to help you learn.\nInput Format\nInput is managed for you\nOutput Format\nOutput is managed for you\nQuestion Video\nCOMMENT\nConstraints\n1.
