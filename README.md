# Pepper: DSA Learning Platform

Welcome to Pepper, a static DSA learning platform inspired by Pepcoding. Pepper aims to provide quality educational materials for learning Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Overview

Pepper offers a collection of courses and problems to help you sharpen your DSA skills. The platform is built using Node.js, React, and Parcel, ensuring a seamless learning experience. Additionally, we utilize Puppeteer for web scraping to gather course and problem data from Pepcoding's archived content.

## Features

- **Courses**: Explore DSA courses categorized into different levels (1, 2, 3) with detailed modules.
- **Problems**: Access a variety of DSA problems to practice and enhance your problem-solving abilities.
- **Dynamic Content**: All course and problem data are stored as JSON files in the `public/Database` directory, ensuring easy access and scalability.
- **Issue Tracking**: We keep track of missing content in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Diwakar-Gupta/pepper/issues/1), allowing for continuous improvement and updates.
