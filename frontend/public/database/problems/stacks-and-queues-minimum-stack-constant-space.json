  "description": "1. You are required to complete the code of our MinStack class. \n2. As data members you've one stack and a min element available in the class. (This is cryptic - take hint from video)\n3. Here is the list of functions that you are supposed to complete\n      3.1. push -> Should accept new data in LIFO manner.\n      3.2. pop -> Should remove and return data in LIFO manner. If not available, print \n       \"Stack underflow\" and return -1.\n      3.3. top -> Should return data in LIFO manner. If not available, print \"Stack \n      underflow\" and return -1.\n     3.4. size -> Should return the number of elements available in the stack.\n     3.5. min -> Should return the smallest element available in the stack. If not \n     available, print \"Stack underflow\" and return -1.\n4. Input and Output is managed for you.\n\nNote -> The judge maynot be able to check if all your functions are O(1) in time, but that is what the expectation is. Also, you can only use constant space.r\n\n### Input Format\n```\nInput is managed for you\n```\n\n### Output Format\n```\nOutput is managed for you\n```\n\n### Constraints\n```\nNone\n```\n\n### Sample Input\n```\npush 10\npush 20\npush 5\npush 8\npush 2\npush 4\npush 11\ntop\nmin\npop\ntop\nmin\npop\ntop\nmin\npop\ntop\nmin\npop\ntop\nmin\npop\ntop\nmin\npop\ntop\nmin\npop\nquit\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n```\n11\n2\n11\n4\n2\n4\n2\n2\n2\n8\n5\n8\n5\n5\n5\n20\n10\n20\n10\n10\n10\n```",
