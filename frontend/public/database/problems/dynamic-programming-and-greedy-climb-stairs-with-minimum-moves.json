  "description": "1. You are given a number n, representing the number of stairs in a staircase.\n2. You are on the 0th step and are required to climb to the top.\n3. You are given n numbers, where ith element's value represents - till how far from the step you \n     could jump to in a single move.  You can of-course fewer number of steps in the move.\n4. You are required to print the number of minimum moves in which you can reach the top of \n     staircase.\nNote -> If there is no path through the staircase print null.\n\n### Input Format\n```\nA number n\n.. n more elements\n```\n\n### Output Format\n```\nA number representing the number of ways to climb the stairs from 0 to top.\n```\n\n### Constraints\n```\n0 <= n <= 20\n0 <= n1, n2, .. <= 20\n```\n\n### Sample Input\n```\n10\n3\n3\n0\n2\n1\n2\n4\n2\n0\n0\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n```\n4\n```",
