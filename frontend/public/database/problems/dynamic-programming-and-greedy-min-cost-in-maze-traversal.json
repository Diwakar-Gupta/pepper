  "description": "1. You are given a number n, representing the number of rows.\n2. You are given a number m, representing the number of columns.\n3. You are given n*m numbers, representing elements of 2d array a, which represents a maze.\n4. You are standing in top-left cell and are required to move to bottom-right cell.\n5. You are allowed to move 1 cell right (h move) or 1 cell down (v move) in 1 motion.\n6. Each cell has a value that will have to be paid to enter that cell (even for the top-left and bottom- \n     right cell).\n7. You are required to traverse through the matrix and print the cost of path which is least costly.\n\n### Input Format\n```\nA number n\nA number m\ne11\ne12..\ne21\ne22..\n.. n * m number of elements\n```\n\n### Output Format\n```\nThe cost of least costly path.\n```\n\n### Constraints\n```\n1 <= n <= 10^2\n1 <= m <= 10^2\n0 <= e1, e2, .. n * m elements <= 1000\n```\n\n### Sample Input\n```\n6\n6\n0 1 4 2 8 2\n4 3 6 5 0 4\n1 2 4 1 4 6\n2 0 7 3 2 2\n3 1 5 9 2 4\n2 7 0 8 5 1\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n```\n23\n```",
