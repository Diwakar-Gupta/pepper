  "description": "1. You are given a partially written GenericTree class.\n2. You are require to complete the body of function IterativePreandPostOrder. The function does not use recursion and prints preorder and postorder of the tree. Both orders are printed in separate lines (preorder first, followed by post order in next line). Elements in an order are separated by space.\n3. Input and Output is managed for you.\n\n### Input Format\n```\nInput is managed for you\n```\n\n### Output Format\n```\nElements in preorder separated by a space\nElements in postorder separated by a space\n```\n\n### Constraints\n```\nNone\n```\n\n### Sample Input\n```\n24\n10 20 -50 -1 60 -1 -1 30 70 -1 -80 110 -1 -120 -1 -1 90 -1 -1 40 -100 -1 -1 -1\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n```\n10 20 -50 60 30 70 -80 110 -120 90 40 -100 \n-50 60 20 70 110 -120 -80 90 30 -100 40 10\n```",
