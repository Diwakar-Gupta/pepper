  "description": "1. You are given a string str of digits. (will never start with a 0)\n2. You are required to encode the str as per following rules\n    1 -> a\n    2 -> b\n    3 -> c\n    ..\n    25 -> y\n    26 -> z\n3. You are required to calculate and print the count of encodings for the string str.\n\n     For 123 -> there are 3 encodings. abc, aw, lc\n     For 993 -> there is 1 encoding. iic \n     For 013 -> This is an invalid input. A string starting with 0 will not be passed.\n     For 103 -> there is 1 encoding. jc\n     For 303 -> there are 0 encodings. But such a string maybe passed. In this case \n     print 0.\n\n### Input Format\n```\nA string str\n```\n\n### Output Format\n```\ncount of encodings\n```\n\n### Constraints\n```\n0 < str.length <= 10\n```\n\n### Sample Input\n```\n123\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n```\n3\n```",
